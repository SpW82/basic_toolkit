Basic toolkit is a set of various basic interactive security utilities that comprises 6 modules in 6 scripts(1 module per script) tied together with a master script, basic_toolkit.py.

No syntax required, just run the scripts.

Each script can be run independently of the master script.

The c_text and f_text scripts are for font design.

The scripts are designed for Linux based systems as Windows does not support certain types of sockets, so not all scripts will work on Windows machines. 

Certain modules operate outside of the system they run on i.e., on other systems. Make sure you have permission to do so.
