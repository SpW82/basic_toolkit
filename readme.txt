Basic toolkit is a set of various basic interactive security utilities built with Python.

Comprised of 6 modules in 6 scripts(1 module per script) tied together with a master script, basic_toolkit.py.

No syntax required, just run the scripts.

Each script can be run independently of the master.

The c_text and f_text scripts are for font design.

Designed with Linux based systems in mind as Windows does not support certain types of sockets, so not all modules will work on Windows machines. 

Certain modules operate outside of the system they run on i.e., on other systems. Make sure you have permission to do so.
